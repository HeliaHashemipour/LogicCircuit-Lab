      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     5 out of     600    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   1,200    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           17
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             2 out of      17   11%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      17    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          15 out of      17   88%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
